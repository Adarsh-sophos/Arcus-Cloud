1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're here at SLAC National Accelerator Lab,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and we're going to see how they use computing to understand the mysteries of the universe.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
[Spencer Gessner:] We're standing in the klystron gallery, formerly the longest building in the world.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
[Richard Mount:] You're here at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is a 50-year-old laboratory, as all the flags on the lampposts around the lab are telling you.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It was founded to build a 2-mile-long linear accelerator.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
SLAC is an accelerator laboratory still.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Its main science is based on accelerating particles and creating new states of matter

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or exploring the nature of matter with the accelerated particles.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This always has generated a lot of data, a lot of information.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's very data-intensive experimental science.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
>From the earliest days of SLAC computing

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to analyze data has been a major part of the activity here.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You really can only study the cosmos by studying it in a computer.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You get one chance to look at it,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
but to understand how it evolved into the state it is now,

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you have to do all this in the computer.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There are massive computations going on for that sort of simulation,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
massive computations in catalysis and material science

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and massive data analysis going on here as well.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The particular particle physics experiment

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that I am involved in right now has some 300 petabytes of disk space--

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
some 300,000 terabytes, some 300 million gigabytes of disk space

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
around the world to do this analysis.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Of course, we are far from understanding everything about the universe,

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but this is probably one of the most data-intensive activity in science today.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The raw data rate coming out of the ATLAS detector that I'm involved in

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
is about a petabyte a second.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's 1 million gigabytes a second.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can't store that with any budget known to man,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
so most of it is inspected on the fly and reduced to a much smaller, but still large, storable amount of data.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right now we are sifting through these many, many petabytes of data

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to look for signals of the Higgs boson, as no doubt people have heard in the news.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There are tantalizing hints that I'm not holding my breath about at all right now,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but this is the way we do it.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You need to have those vast amounts of data

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
just to pick out the things that will really revolutionize physics in there,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and you need to understand all of it in detail, because what you're looking for

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is something slightly unusual compared with everything else.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you don't understand everything else perfectly then you don't understand anything.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
[Max Swiatlowski:] We're looking at one of the racks that contains

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the ATLAS proof buster at SLAC.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
ATLAS is an experimental Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that collides protons, fundamental building blocks of nature,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
traveling at very, very, very close to the speed of light

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
with trillions of times the energy that they have at room temperature.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You get many and many of these collisions happening at once

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and this enormous machine that reads out trillions of data channels.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
At the end of the day, you have this enormous amount of data--petabytes of data--

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that you have to analyse looking for very rare, very particular signatures inside of that.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If I want to look for a rare signature--something that had a lot of energy

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and a lot of really strange particles at once--

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
there are trillions and trillions of these events stored on this machine.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
To look for them in any reasonable amount of time,

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have to do many searches at once.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have to use all the cores on the computers--

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the hundreds of cores on the machine all running at full-speed at the same time--

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to have any hope of doing it in any reasonable amount of time.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
[Richard Mount:] This isn't the sort of thing that search engines currently do.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They're looking for text strings and indexing all the text strings that they find

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
in some way like this.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What we have is very, very structured.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We know the structure of these data.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We know exactly how to go to anything that we want to get to in these data,

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
because the way in which everything is linked together is very well understood.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Things will go wrong all the time.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You cannot assume you won't lose data from the disk.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You send it by network from one computer center to another.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You cannot assume it arrives undamaged.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You cannot assume your computers don't die in the middle of calculations.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Everything can go wrong, so the computing we do for the LHC

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
has many layers of error correction and retry.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Some of the basic failure rates are quite high,

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
but by the time everything has been fairly automatically retried

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and errors have been corrected, we get high throughput and a high success rate.
